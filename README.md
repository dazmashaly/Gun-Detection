# Gun Detection Using YOLOv_8

This project uses the YOLOv_8 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to detect guns from security camera footage. The data for this project was collected from 70 YouTube videos of crime activities and annotated using Roboflow. Please note that this is a relatively small dataset, and the model could improve significantly with more data.

## Here are a few use cases for this project:

### Public Safety Surveillance:
Utilize the guns detection security camera model to monitor public areas like parks, streets, or events, providing real-time alerts to law enforcement when guns are detected, helping prevent potential violent incidents and enhancing public security.

### School Safety: 
Integrate the model into security cameras in and around schools to detect firearms on school grounds, quickly alerting school administrators and law enforcement to any potential threats, which aids in ensuring the safety of students, teachers, and staff.

### Retail and Shopping Mall Security: 
Attach the guns detection model to mall security systems and retail store entrance cameras to detect concealed or openly carried firearms, enabling security teams to respond swiftly to any potential threat and maintain a safe shopping environment.

### Public Transit Security: 
Equip transport systems like buses, trains, and subway stations with the guns detection security camera to identify firearms being carried unlawfully, facilitating immediate response from law enforcement or security personnel and improving overall transit safety.

### Airport Security and Customs Checks: 
Implement the model into airport surveillance systems for enhanced detection of firearms in passenger luggage or on individuals, assisting in maintaining a secure environment and reinforcing airport security procedures.
